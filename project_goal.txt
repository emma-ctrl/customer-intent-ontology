AI Engineer — Take Home Task
Interview
Our problem
We have just onboarded a new customer, called BrownBox 🎉
Before we turn on our AI agent for BrownBox, we want to categorise the
conversations into a set of customer intents. This will give us a high level
understanding of the reasons customers are contacting BrownBox, as well as give
us a lever to control which conversations we want our AI agent to participate in.
For example, we may not want to participate in any conversations related to fraud!
Dataset
You can find BrownBox’s customer support conversations here. You will need to
create a (free) huggingface account to be able to download the dataset.
For the challenge you should only use the conversation column, as we would not
have access to any of the other dataset columns in real life.
ℹ Note
This is a fictional dataset built using GPT3.5.
This means the conversations are not very realistic, they are very simple and
very clean, which doesn’t make them very representative of the real world, but
it’s a starting point!
The Challenge
Part #1
AI Engineer — Take Home Task Interview 1
We would like you to build a customer intent ontology for BrownBox. There are no
constraints on how you construct the ontology, these are up to you to define as
you wish! However we would love for you to explicitly define any assumptions or
constraints you set and talk us through your thinking.
ℹ Note 1:
The purpose of the customer intent ontology is to allow us to use specialised AI
agents that have been purpose-built for individual customer intents. For example
the customer intent “Initiate Return” will be handled by a different AI agent,
compared to the “Cancel Order” customer intent.
ℹ Note 2:
We cannot rely on external stakeholders to advise us on how to structure,
optimise, or maintain this customer intent ontology - all decisions have to be made
by us.
Part #2
We’d like you to define an evaluation mechanism for this ontology. How do we
know if it is good enough, and how would we know when to stop iterating?
ℹ Note 1: We cannot use the issue_area , issue_category , issue_subcategory columns
from the dataset, as we would not have those in real life 🙂.
ℹ Note 2: Customer intent ontologies will change over time as companies evolve.
We’d like for you to think how we would maintain the ontology over time,
deprecate intents or add new intents.
Good luck! ❤
